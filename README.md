# Oil-spill-Detection
Oil spill detection is a critical task for protecting marine ecosystems and supporting rapid environmental response. This project focuses on identifying oil spills from satellite imagery using remote sensing and machine learning techniques. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly from Sentinel-1, is utilized due to its ability to operate under all weather and lighting conditions. Oil-covered water surfaces appear as dark regions in SAR images because oil dampens surface capillary waves, reducing backscatter. By applying image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification methods, the system effectively distinguishes oil spills from surrounding seawater and look-alike phenomena, enabling automated and large-scale monitoring of marine pollution.

# Data Source
The primary data source used in this project is Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Program. Sentinel-1 GRD products are selected due to their high temporal resolution and all-weather, day-and-night imaging capability, which makes them well suited for oil spill detection over ocean surfaces. SAR backscatter data, particularly in VV polarization, is used to identify oil slicks, as oil films suppress capillary waves and appear as dark patches on the water surface. Additional reference data and reported oil spill locations are used for validation and analysis.

# Methodology
The methodology involves acquiring Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and performing standard preprocessing steps such as radiometric calibration, speckle filtering, and terrain correction to enhance image quality. Oil spill candidates are identified based on their low backscatter characteristics caused by the damping of surface capillary waves. Relevant features, including backscatter intensity and texture measures, are extracted to capture the contrast between oil-covered and clean water surfaces. These features are then used in classification techniques, ranging from threshold-based methods to machine learning models, to distinguish oil spills from surrounding seawater and look-alike phenomena. Post-processing steps are applied to reduce noise and false detections, resulting in accurate and reliable oil spill mapping.
